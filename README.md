# DiscordBot
Discord Bot: Creating a Discord Bot in Java was difficult, but it was managable! Introducing Kevin's Bot, who does many things for a server! I origonally made this bot because my friends wanted a way to get everyones attention when they wanted to play games such as Among Us or Team Fight Tactics, so I created this bot in order to make it happen. However, this was when I only knew Java, so I had to code it in Java. It was extremely difficult, as JDA is pretty finicky, but I managed to create a semi-decent model. My Bot includes:
-A hi command
-A info command
-A help command
-A clear command
-A TFT headcount command
-A Among Us headcount command
-A annoy command
-A private message command
